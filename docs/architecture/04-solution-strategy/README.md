# 4. Solution strategy

## Technology decisions

ArcShape is distributed as the `@arcshape/cli` npm workspace package and runs locally in the adopting repository. Canonical documentation lives in `docs/`; the repository root is a private npm workspace that owns development tooling. The CLI and architecture reader are implemented in `packages/cli/src/`, and distributable templates and capabilities are in `packages/cli/assets/`.

## Top-level decomposition

- `packages/cli/src/bin/arcshape.mjs` dispatches human-invoked CLI commands.
- `packages/cli/src/bin/` contains CLI modules for setup, capability management, sessions, validation, and documentation sync.
- `packages/cli/src/arc42-site/` contains the architecture reader implementation.
- `packages/cli/assets/architecture/` contains the Markdown scaffold shipped in the package.
- `packages/cli/assets/capabilities/` contains provider-neutral skills, the provider discovery registry, and exact legacy hashes for migration.
- `src/public-site/` contains the ArcShape-owned static product site source and assets. Cloudflare Pages serves this surface independently of engineering-artifact publication.
- `src/engineering-portal/` contains the compact landing page published at the GitHub Pages root. The workflow generates the Product Snapshot and Architecture Snapshot from canonical Markdown into separate routes.
- `docs/product/model/` records product intent; it is not generated from implementation.
- `openspec/` contains temporary delivery planning and validation integration.

## Quality realization

The CLI uses exclusive file creation and compares existing content before deciding whether a file is up to date or conflicts. AI reasoning is reserved for the separate assistant workflow layer; deterministic CLI commands own setup and bookkeeping.
